# Extracting and Visualizing Stock Data

This is a repository for my final assignment of the [Python Project for Data Science Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-project-for-data-science), offered by IBM on Coursera. 

For this project, I assumed the role of a Data Scientist / Data Analyst working for a new startup investment firm that helps customers invest their money in stocks. The job was to extract financial data like historical share price and quarterly revenue reportings from various sources using Python libraries and webscraping on popular stocks. After collecting this data, I visualized it in a dashboard to identify patterns or trends. The stocks worked with were Tesla and GameStop.

The course is part of the [IBM Data Science Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science).
